#Cloning the Repository
#Branching: It is best practice for each collaborator to create a new branch for their work (e.g., git checkout -b my-new-feature). This isolates changes and prevents #conflicts.
#Making Changes and Committing: Collaborators make their changes, then git add and git commit them to their local branch.
#Pushing Changes: Collaborators push their local branch to the remote repository on GitHub (e.g., git push origin my-new-feature).
